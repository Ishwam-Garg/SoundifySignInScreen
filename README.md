# SoundifySignInScreen
This is the code for Soundify sign in screen with authorization code and assets!!
Note it does not currently support email and password login and apple account login thus user can use google and facebook login currently.
All assets are added in this repository.
Note you need to replace googleservices file with file from your firebase otherwise this code won't work as access to my firebase is not public.
You need to enable google and facebook login in firebase.
for google login you need SHA-1 and SHA-256 KEYS. 
whereas for facebook you need to register your app on facebook.developers and requires a MD5 key.
